# Confrontation Engine

* This Python project simulates various confrontation scenarios and allows users to input their responses while receiving feedback through GPT (optionally).

* This project is designed for those with confrontation anxiety, for a controlled and relaxed application, where users can at least practice and gain confidence.

## Features:
- **Text-Based Generation**: Draws a scenario and displays for user to read.
- **Text Input**: Allows user to draw up their own answers to situations or scenarios.
- **GPT Analysis**: Optionally, enable GPT-3 analysis for feedback on how well you handled the confrontation.

## Future Updates:
- **Improved UI**: Better looking interface. *examples on how to use*
- **Menu Improvements**: Addition of options to select the person involved in the confrontation (e.g., public member, spouse, parent) and the intensity of the response (e.g., low, medium, high).
- **Realistic Scenarios**: The confrontation scenarios should reflect more realistic situations, such as being criticized at work, arguments with a spouse, and family disagreements.
- **NLP Buzz Word Analysis**: Using NLP to make reviews instead of GPT.
- **Actions**: Allow user to define actions.
- **Continuality and Argumentative Scenario Follow-up**: Memory for system.
- **Wisdom and Psychology Tips**: Transistions into researched points and proverbs that help the user to gain more insights.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-3 analysis) - if applied
